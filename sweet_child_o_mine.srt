1
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:37,540
She's got a smile, but it seems the mirror reminds me of childhood memories

2
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,840
Where everything wants to stretch as the bright blue skies

3
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,940
Now and then, when I see a face, she takes me away to that special place

4
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,820
And if I stand too long, I'd probably break down and cry

5
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,680
Oh, oh, oh, don't reach out tonight

6
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh, oh, oh, don't reach out tonight

7
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:38,400
It got eyes of the blue and skies that gave faith for the rain

8
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,980
I hated to look into those eyes and see it down to rain

9
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:54,000
Her hair reminds me of a long safe place where as a job I'd hang out

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,060
And bring all the thunder and the rain and the

11
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:23,000
Why did they pass me by giggling?

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,160
Oh, yeah

13
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,400
Oh, oh, oh oh

14
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,700
Sweet love of my eyes

15
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:50,880
Sweet love of my eyes

16
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:23,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

17
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:53,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, a, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

18
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
That Gerrard.

19
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,360
Where do we go now?

20
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,080
B-i-i-i-i-i...

21
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,820
Where do we go now?

22
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:05,340
Ooh!

23
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,440
Whoa!

24
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,120
Where do we go?

25
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:31,000
Where do we go, you?

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,660
Winter, winter

28
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,100
All of my life

29
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,900
All of my life
