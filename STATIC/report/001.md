### Detailed Evaluation

#### 1. Accuracy
The script accurately fetches webpage content, parses it using `BeautifulSoup`, and extracts relevant text content (paragraphs). The cleaning process effectively removes unwanted characters and structures, ensuring clean extracted text for further processing.

#### 2. Efficiency
- **Web Page Fetching**: Efficiently fetches webpage content using `requests`.
- **HTML Parsing**: Utilizes `BeautifulSoup` for standard and efficient HTML parsing.
- **Text Extraction and Cleaning**: Adequately extracts and cleans text but may need optimization for larger webpages.

#### 3. Code Structure and Readability
The code is organized into functions (`scrape_and_clean` and `clean_text`), which is good for modularity. More comments and documentation could enhance code clarity. Consider breaking down functions into smaller, focused units.

#### 4. Error Handling
The script checks HTTP response status codes to handle failed webpage retrievals (`response.status_code != 200`). More comprehensive error handling could cover scenarios like invalid URLs or network-related issues.

#### 5. Edge Cases and Robustness
- **JavaScript-heavy Pages**: May struggle with webpages heavily reliant on JavaScript.
- **Tag Structures**: Primarily focuses on `<p>` tag extraction; other structures are not universally supported.

Consider improving robustness to handle diverse webpage structures and scenarios.

### Bugs and Potential Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for various scenarios.
- **Modularity**: Enhance separation of concerns for improved maintainability.
- **Optimization**: Optimize text extraction and cleaning for larger webpages.
- **Documentation**: Improve code comments and documentation for better understanding and maintainability.
